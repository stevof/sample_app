# I added this check for a nil variable so the home page ('/')
# won't throw exception when micropost form is posted with invalid
# values. The tutorial (listing 10.45) has you add an empty 
# @feed_items to 
# microposts_controller.rb to avoid this, but I think there's
# still a bug -- it won't show the feed items after the invalid
# post (they disappear if there are any).
# This check for nil fixes that bug, but we'll leave it out for now.
#if @feed_items && @feed_items.any? 
if @feed_items.any?
